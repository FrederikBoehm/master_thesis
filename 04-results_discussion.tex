\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{chap:results_and_discussion}
This chapter will present the results of the thesis and it discusses the limitations of our approach.
As mentioned before, we are interested in a sensible tradeoff between a performance improvement and a good image quality.
We therefore measure the render time of our \ac{lod} approach and the mesh ground truth.
The image quality is mainly determined by comparing the results visually to the ground truth, but we also provide the mean \FLIP \cite{flip} error to quantify the difference.
We choose this error because it gives a good approximation of the difference a human perceives when alternating between two images \cite{flip}.
For the sake of completeness, we also provide the mean \ac{ssim} and the \ac{psnr} in Appendix \ref{chap:psnr_and_ssim_errors}.
All images are rendered in our custom physically based path-tracer that we introduced in Section \ref{sec:rendering}.
We run the renderer on a system with an Intel Xeon E3-1230 v3 \ac{cpu}, 16 GB of RAM and a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 \ac{gpu}.
We performed experiments on the forest scene with 9924 trees, which we present in Section \ref{sec:forest} and on single model instances, which we discuss in Section \ref{sec:experiments_on_single_model_instances}.
For the forest scene, we additionally analyze the memory usage, when using \acsp{lod}.

\section{Experiments on the Forest Scene}
\label{sec:forest}
As we explained, in Section \ref{sec:scene_generation} we choose our \acsp{lod} based on the heuristic that one voxel covers at most one pixel.
Figure \ref{fig:render_comparison} shows a rendering of a scene that was generated with this heuristic compared to a reference rendering that uses only meshes.

\end{figure}
It can be observed that the structure of the volumetric trees cannot be distinguished from the mesh representations which speaks for our heuristic for \ac{lod} selection.
However, when we look at the yellow framed image segment, we see that the shading differs between both representations.
The volumetric trees generally look darker, which is especially pronounced on the side that faces the sun.
For our usage, the ray offsetting, that we introduced in Section \ref{sec:rendering}, showed only neglectable improvement of the shading.
In the magenta framed image segment, we can additionally see that a mesh is replaced by a volume, although it is clearly too close to the camera for the regular distance dependent \ac{lod} selection.
This is quite literally an edge case of our \ac{lod} selection procedure: We only check whether the vertices of the volumetric bounding box are within the view frustum, the edges connecting the vertices can still be visible in the frustum, thus also making the volume visible.
Unfortunately, we did not catch this shortcoming during development.
The differences in the cyan framed image segment are quite subtle: The tree in the reference rendering has a slight yellow tint that the \ac{lod} rendering lacks.
It is easier to see this error if we look at the \FLIP error map between the renderings from Figure \ref{fig:render_comparison} in Figure \ref{fig:error_map}.

	\label{fig:error_map}
\end{figure}
The tree in the cyan framed image segment visibly has an increased error compared to the surrounding trees.
This error is the result of indirect illumination: In the reference rendering there are mesh models outside the view frustum which reflect light on models in the view frustum.
These meshes outside the view frustum are replaced by volumes in the \ac{lod} rendering, which reflect less light.
The error map also makes the switch from mesh to volume rendering clearly visible, since the error suddenly increases.
As we observed in the renderings, the error is particularly high on the side that faces the sun.

In order to find the reason for the large shading difference on the sun-facing side, we split up the \acsp{brdf} and phase functions into the specular and diffuse component.
Intuitively we expect that these differences are specular highlights on the surfaces that are not rendered in the volumes.
However, looking at individual renderings of the diffuse and specular components in Figure \ref{fig:diffuse_specular_breakdown}, we find that these bright regions are in fact a result of the diffuse \ac{brdf}.

	\label{fig:diffuse_specular_breakdown}
\end{figure}
In the volumes, the diffuse phase function gives way more uniform looking trees without these bright regions on the sun-facing side.
The specular component gives discrete specular highlights on the surfaces while the specular phase function leads to reflections across the whole medium.
So our approach fails in preserving the visual appearance of the meshes.
We identify two reasons for this limitation: First, the \ac{sggx} phase function is defined on the whole unit sphere (recall Figure \ref{fig:sggx_ndf}), which means that half of the rays are reflected into the medium where they are attenuated, while for surfaces all rays are reflected away from the surface.
Second, it is likely that this error occurred due to the usage of an isotropic microflake projected area, which directly influences our density values.
As we showed in Section \ref{sec:mesh_filtering} the optimization of the density depends on this projected area and by choosing a constant value we ignore for example how the roughness of a material influences the density, which would normally be reflected in the matrix $S$. % TODO: Maybe add example for effect of lowering roughness of leaves
Using an anisotropic projected area therefore can lead to a significantly different look.
The filtering procedure, however, would become more complex.
Experiments in this direction are outside of the scope of this thesis.

% This affects our density values, since the density is also optimized based on the microflake projected area $sigma$.
%  which effectively leads to reflection directions that are uniformly scattered on the unit sphere.
% % Second, it is likely that this error is due to the usage of an isotropic extinction coefficient, which effectively leads to reflection directions that are uniformly scattered on the unit sphere.
% Therefore we could reduce the error by using an anisotropic extinction, which would lead to a more complex filtering procedure.

Apart from these visual problems, the render time for the \ac{lod} approach is another concern.
The duration with $\SI{8723}{\s}$ for 1024 samples per pixel (Figure \ref{fig:render_comparison_lod}) is currently slower than rendering only the meshes, which took $\SI{5463}{\s}$ for 1024 samples per pixel (Figure \ref{fig:render_comparison_mesh}).
As we just discussed, we recognize the \acsp{lod} mainly by their different color and not by their details or blurriness.
We therefore have some room left for tweaking the distance at which we switch to \ac{lod} rendering or we can use coarser \acsp{lod}.
Tweaking the distance translates to changing the number of pixels a voxel may cover.
As we wrote in Section \ref{sec:scene_generation}, our heuristic currently ensures that a voxel covers at most one pixel.
Now we relax this restriction and measure render times when a voxel covers 1, 4, 9 or 16 pixels.
Additionally, we test how changing the voxel size of the finest \ac{lod} affects the performance.
In the first experiment, the voxels in our finest \ac{lod} had a size of $\SI{0.1}{\m}$.
Now we choose a minimal voxel size of $\SI{0.1}{\m}$, $\SI{0.2}{\m}$, $\SI{0.4}{\m}$, $\SI{0.8}{\m}$, $\SI{1.6}{\m}$, $\SI{3.2}{\m}$ and $\SI{6.4}{\m}$.
In total this gives us 28 combinations.
% We visualize our measurements in Figure \ref{fig:render_durations} as a heat map.
In Figure \ref{fig:lod_grid} we visualize the durations as well as the \FLIP error for rendering the different configurations with 1024 samples per pixel.

	\label{fig:lod_grid}
\end{figure}
We can see that when we start \ac{lod} rendering with rougher \acsp{lod} we can reduce render times to a certain degree before they rise again.
The decline happens because rougher \acsp{lod} are less memory intensive then the fine \acsp{lod} and therefore easier to cache.
At the same time increasing the minimum voxel size for a fixed number of covered pixels pushes the boundary of the \ac{lod} switch away from the camera which increases the number of meshes to be rendered.
The meshes take longer to render than the rough \acsp{lod}, therefore the render time increases again.

We get another view on the different combinations between the number of covered pixels and the minimum voxel size if we visualize the bounding boxes, like we previously did in Figure \ref{fig:visualize_lods}.
Now we not only show a rendering from above the scene but also from the main camera perspective.
Figure \ref{fig:visualize_lods_different_configurations_covered_pixels_fixed} visualizes the previously described effect, that the distance at which \acsp{lod} are rendered increases, when the minimum voxel size is increased.

    \label{fig:visualize_lods_different_configurations}
\end{figure}
For the case of a fixed number of covered pixels and a minimum voxel size of $\SI{0.8}{\m}$, it is also interesting to note that the distance based \acsp{lod} still cover almost half of the circular forest, although they are barely visible from the main camera's perspective.
Figure \ref{fig:visualize_lods_different_configurations_min_voxel_size_fixed} on the other hand, is analogous to the first column of Figure \ref{fig:lod_grid_durations}, as we also fixed the minimum voxel size at $\SI{0.1}{\m}$ and increase the number of covered pixels.
The figure intuitively explains the near doubling of the render time between 1 covered pixel and 16 covered pixels, since we start \ac{lod} rendering right in front of the camera for 16 covered pixels.


% We get another view on the increasing distances of \ac{lod} rendering when we look at the colored bounding boxes of the volumes again ...
Looking back at Figure \ref{fig:lod_grid}, the overall best result is achieved by dropping the three finest \acsp{lod} and let each voxel cover up to four pixels.
The scene then renders in $\SI{4549}{\s}$ which is a 17\% improvement over rendering only meshes.
Additionally, it has the positive side-effect that the shading problem is less noticeable, which is reflected in a drop in the mean \FLIP error from 0.073 to 0.038.
Figure \ref{fig:render_and_error_fastest} shows this rendering with the corresponding \FLIP error map.

The mean \FLIP error is 0.038.}
    \label{fig:render_and_error_fastest}
\end{figure}
We can further decrease the mean \FLIP error down to 0.031, for example, by choosing a minimum voxel size of 6.4 meters and let each voxel cover one pixel, at the cost of a higher render time.

The last experiment we perform on the forest scene analyzes the memory consumption of the different configurations of the number of covered pixels and the minimum voxel size.
Since we use instancing of the geometry, texture and volume grids, the memory footprint between all configurations is roughly the same.
But we can analyze how much memory is used if we would not use instancing.
This gives us an idea, how our approach performs regarding memory consumption, if we had many distinct models in the scene, which is typical for feature films.
This analysis could also be interesting if the scene's assets need to be streamed over a network and the load on the network has to be minimized.
Due to system limitations, we cannot render such scenes anymore, but it is enough to know the memory usage of each model's \ac{lod} and the distribution of the model's \acsp{lod} in a scene to obtain the total memory consumption.
Without instancing, the reference scene would consume $\SI{830}{GB}$ of memory.
As Figure \ref{fig:memory_usage} visualizes in the familiar heatmap, we can reduce this footprint, by choosing any of the different \ac{lod} configurations.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{img/results/memory_usage.png}
    \caption[Visualization of the memory consumption of different scene configurations]{Heatmap of the memory consumptions of different scene configurations when using no instancing. Bright regions indicate low memory usage, dark regions indicate high memory usage.}
    \label{fig:memory_usage}
\end{figure}
It is obvious, that with increasing minimum voxel sizes, the memory usage increases as well.
However, increasing the number of pixels that a voxel may cover, reduces the memory consumption.
Comparing Figure \ref{fig:memory_usage} and Figure \ref{fig:flip_errors}, we see that a high memory consumption correlates with a low \FLIP error, while a low memory footprint correlates with a high \FLIP error.
The memory consumption therefore behaves inverse to the \FLIP error.
Interestingly, the configuration with the lowest render time from Figure \ref{fig:lod_grid_durations}, does not have the smallest memory footprint.
We can therefore conclude that the memory consumption is not the only variable that plays into the render time of a scene.

\section{Experiments on Single Model Instances}
\label{sec:experiments_on_single_model_instances}
Now that we have a good idea of the performance and quality implications of our approach, we perform further tests on single instances of some tree models.
This gives us finer control over which \ac{lod} should be rendered at which distance.
We use the models \textit{Celtis australis adult} (Figure \ref{fig:EU06a}) and \textit{Acer rubrum adult} (Figure \ref{fig:EA01a}) for our tests. % TODO: Maybe use PR04a instead

	\label{fig:single_model_instances}
\end{figure}

As a first experiment, we render a single instance of all mesh and volume representations at different distances.
We can see the render times of this experiment plotted in Figure \ref{fig:render_time_comparisons}.
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\linewidth}

    \end{subfigure}
	\caption[Plots of the render times depending on the distance from the camera]{These plots show the render times depending on the distance from the camera for single instances of the model \textit{Celtis australis adult} (a) and for \textit{Acer rubrum adult} (b). Meshes render faster than all \acsp{lod} until a certain distance.}
	\label{fig:render_time_comparisons}
\end{figure}
Interestingly, the meshes first render faster than all \acsp{lod}.
With increasing distance, the render times of the volumetric representations then decrease rapidly and eventually fall below the render time of the mesh representation.
For the model \textit{Celtis australis adult} this is the case after $\SI{800}{\m}$ and for the model \textit{Acer rubrum adult} a \ac{lod} renders faster after $\SI{700}{\m}$.
Surprisingly, the render times for the mesh representations only decline in the beginning, but after a certain distance they rise steadily.
An explanation for this could be that at a certain distance the random sampling of a pixel produces large jumps across the bounding volume hierarchy, which leads to many cache misses.


As a second experiment we want to fix the distance between the camera and the model and measure how the image quality in terms of the \FLIP error and render times change when we choose different \acsp{lod}.
Since the model covers only a small area of the image, we crop the image before we compute the \FLIP error.

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\linewidth}

The \FLIP error is computed on a relevant image segment.}
	\label{fig:performance_quality}
\end{figure}
We observe in Figure \ref{fig:performance_quality} that the render times fall in an exponential fashion, while the \FLIP errors show logarithmic growth.
Note however, that the voxel sizes of our \acsp{lod} increase exponentially by construction, which we have to consider in our interpretation.
We could alternatively draw the plots over the linear \ac{lod} level instead of the exponentially growing voxel size.
Regardless of the choice of the abscissa, the plots visualize the tradeoff well that we have to make: We can either improve the performance by choosing rougher \acsp{lod} which leads to a high image error.
Or we aim for a high image quality by selecting a detailed \ac{lod}, which leads to longer render times.
Another observation that we made during the single instance rendering is that the approach by \citeauthor{vicini2021non} of offsetting the scattered ray to the voxel border impairs the quality of the representation.

This is especially pronounced when rough \acsp{lod} are viewed from a close distance.
Figure \ref{fig:rough_lods} shows the effect of the ray offsetting on the \acsp{lod} with a voxel size of $\SI{6.4}{\m}$.
The voxel borders are clearly visible in these renderings, since the transmission of a ray is not updated by the offset.
For close-up renderings of fine \acsp{lod} this artifact is less visible and in landscape scenes, like the forest scene from Section \label{sec:forest_experiments}, we were not able to perceive it.
