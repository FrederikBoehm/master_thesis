\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis proposes an approach for \acf{lod} rendering by representing surface meshes with volumes.
We use ray casting to filter the surface meshes and obtain volume representations with differing detail.
The optimal \ac{lod} is selected using a heuristic which compares the number of voxels the camera sees with the number of pixels the volume covers on the image plane.
We test different ratios of these numbers and different minimum voxel sizes in order to find a tradeoff between a good render performance and image quality.
Rendering is done in a custom developed physically based path-tracer.
