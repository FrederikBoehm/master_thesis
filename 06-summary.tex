\chapter{Summary}
\label{chap:summary}
This thesis presented an approach for filtering textured surface meshes, thereby converting them into volumes.
The resulting volumetric representations occupy 22\% less disk space.
We further developed a scene generator that uniformly distributes models on a circular area.
It selects an appropriate \ac{lod} based on the number of pixels that a volume covers compared to the number of voxels visible from the camera.
We then rendered a scene containing only meshes and scenes with different \ac{lod} selection strategies in our custom physically based path tracer.
We find that we can decrease render times by up to 17\% while introducing a \FLIP error of 0.038.
Lower \FLIP errors are possible at the cost of higher render times.
We can therefore conclude that volumetric representations of surface meshes can reduce rendertimes while introducing noticeable differences in the image quality in a side by side comparison.
