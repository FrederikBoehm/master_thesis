\chapter{Summary}
\label{chap:summary}
This thesis presented an approach for filtering textured surface meshes, thereby converting them into volumes.
The resulting volumetric representations occupy 22\% less disk space.
We further developed a scene generator that uniformly distributes models on a circular area.
It selects an appropriate \ac{lod} based on the number of pixels that a volume covers compared to the number of voxels visible from the camera.
We then rendered a forest scene containing only meshes and scenes with different \ac{lod} selection strategies in our custom physically based path tracer.
The results showed, that we can decrease render times by up to 17\% while introducing a \FLIP error of 0.038.
Lower \FLIP errors are possible at the cost of higher render times.
Additionally, we performed tests on single model instances and quantified the distance at which there is a performance benefit of the volumetric representations.
Within the scope of the single instance tests we also showed the error introduced by coarser \ac{lod} at a fixed render distance.
We can therefore conclude that volumetric representations of surface meshes can reduce rendertimes while introducing noticeable differences in the image quality in a side by side comparison.
